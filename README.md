## camvisiotech-edge-ai-gsm
CamVisioTech is a standalone AI-powered face detection and recognition system built on the Maixduino hardware. This project is designed to operate independently without relying on external computing resources, making it efficient and accessible in low-resource environments. The project integrates both WiFi and GSM modules for network connectivity, allowing for real-time alerts and versatile deployment in environments with limited internet access. This particular repository contains the setup for the GSM based approach to it.

## **Project Overview**

A smart surveillance system capable of:
- Detecting faces and objects in real time using the **NNCase** and **Yolo** based ML models.
- When an Intruder is detected, buzzer goes off and similarly any actuator can be controlled.
- Sending Telegram notifications to alert the user bu utilising GSM capabalities. ( Other Third Party applications can also be integrated easily using applications like IFTTT, PipeDream etc. )
- We utilise efficient MQTT protocol and Thingspeak as a mediator for this.
- No external computing is needed; all processing, from running ML model calculations to sending alerts, is handled on-board.
